# Walk
Simulation of Random Walks



Animal movement predictions through a random walk simulation. Implementation and assessment of the performance of several of movement schemes in two dimensions:

    1. Biased Random Walks (BRW)
    2. Correlated Random Walks (CRW)
    3. Biased Correlated Random Walks (BCRW)
